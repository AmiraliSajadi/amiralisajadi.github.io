                            Interpersonal trust plays a crucial role in facilitating collaborative tasks, such as
                            software development. While previous research recognizes the significance of trust in an
                            organizational setting, there is a lack of understanding in how trust is exhibited in OSS
                            distributed teams, where there is an absence of direct, in-person communications. To foster
                            trust and collaboration in OSS teams, we need to understand what trust is and how it is
                            exhibited in written developer communications (e.g., pull requests, chats). In this paper,
                            we first investigate various dimensions of trust to identify the ways trusting behavior can
                            be observed in OSS. Next, we sample a set of 100 GitHub pull requests from Apache Software
                            Foundation (ASF) projects, to analyze and demonstrate how each dimension of trust can be
                            exhibited. Our findings provide preliminary insights into cues that might be helpful to
                            automatically assess team dynamics and establish interpersonal trust in OSS teams, leading
                            to successful and sustainable OSS.

                            Emotions play a significant role in teamwork and collaborative activities like software
                            development. While researchers have analyzed developer emotions in various software
                            artifacts (e.g., issues, pull requests), few studies have focused on understanding the broad
                            spectrum of emotions expressed in chats. As one of the most widely used means of
                            communication, chats contain valuable information in the form of informal conversations,
                            such as negative perspectives about adopting a tool. In this paper, we present a dataset of
                            developer chat messages manually annotated with a wide range of emotion labels (and
                            sub-labels), and analyze the type of information present in those messages. We also
                            investigate the unique signals of emotions specific to chats and distinguish them from other
                            forms of software communication. Our findings suggest that chats have fewer expressions of
                            Approval and Fear but more expressions of Curiosity compared to GitHub comments. We also
                            notice that Confusion is frequently observed when discussing programming-related information
                            such as unexpected software behavior. Overall, our study highlights the potential of mining
                            emotions in developer chats for supporting software maintenance and evolution tools.
